\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}

In this article, we presented a systematic mapping study to provide an overview understanding of SPL-related research on security in the context of configurable systems and their data storage. 
Precisely, 50 publications (2013--2022) of a variety of domains were analyzed.
Overall, we identified highly interesting insights and XY concrete research gaps.

For future research, we plan to build on the findings of this study, especially those related to security in the context of data storage or the communication between software system and storage.
In more detail, we aim to conduct a systematic literature to extract more detailed results. 
Moreover, it is planned to analyze the technological structure of configurable storage systems to develop a framework consisting of their most relevant technological layers as a basis for a derivation of configurable security patterns.
