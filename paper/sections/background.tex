\section{Background} \label{sec:background}

In the following section, we provide relevant background information on \emph{configurable systems}, \emph{data storage}, and \emph{security}.


\subsection{Configurable Systems}\label{sec:background:configsystems}

A configurable system is characterized by a number of  (diverse) features (i.e., user-visible functions) that can be customized to meet customer needs, e.g., specific customer or user requirements, hardware constraints, or even legal regulations.


\subsection{Data Storage}\label{sec:background:storage}

Data storage, i.e., a medium that is able to store specific data in a certain technological way, is usually generally classified by one of three main organization structures, i.e., centralized, decentralized, or distributed~\cite{furht2010CloudFundamentals,wu2017distributed}. 
Centralized storage solutions, e.g., centralized relational SQL databases, are built around one single point (i.e., a server) handling all major processing or storage task.
Consequently, all machines are connected to the central point where the data is stored~\cite{ramamritham1996RealTimeDatabases,chowdhury2018BlockchainAnalysis}.
In contrast, decentralized storage solutions, e.g., decentralized NOSQL databases in the context of blockchain applications, rely on the distribution of processing or storage steps among several machines with no or limited coordination~\cite{wu2017distributed,ayoade2018DecentralizedEnvironment}.
Thus, the dependency on individual processing points is much weaker than in centralized solutions~\cite{ayoade2018DecentralizedEnvironment,mcconaghy2016BigchainDB:Database,Bao2020WhenIssues}.
If a decentralized system provides a (close) coordination between independent machines, it is called a distributed system~\cite{van2002distributed,wu2017distributed}.
For instance, intercloud environments relying on a variety of storage mediums are usually associated with this organization structure~\cite{celesti2010security,leite2016autonomic}. 

Data storage mediums usually rely on certain storage environments that are oriented towards self-hosting (i.e., an environment located on a local machine) or outsourcing.
In the context of outsourcing, which has become increasingly widespread for enterprises in recent years, there are several common technologies, especially cloud, edge, and fog~\cite{gabel2017secure,correia2020SafeguardingEdge}.
These environments are created based on a complex combination of software and hardware components able to provide server-based storage space at a high level of efficiency, flexibility, scalability, and on-demand data access based on the Internet of Things~\cite{markovic2013SmartComputing,silva2018SecurityComputing}.  
Outsourcing solutions often serve as the technology where data storage and data processing can be built on, leading to the creation of service-based systems or infrastructures, usually called Software as a Service (SaaS) or Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)~\cite{lee2009quality,kulkarni2012cloud,serrano2015infrastructure}.


\subsection{Security}\label{sec:background:security}

According to the established norms and standards (i.e., the ISO/IEC 27000 series, ISO/IEC 25010, ...), security is a characteristic of a software system aimed to protect its stored or processed data or information against threats of attacks, vulnerabilities, errors, or even nature (e.g., in the context of safety-critical systems)~\cite{ISOIEC250102011}.

subcharacteristics or security goals called confidentiality~\cite{ISOIEC250102011,ISOIEC270002018}: property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes~\cite{ISOIEC270002018} integrity~\cite{ISOIEC250102011,ISOIEC270002018}, availability~\cite{ISOIEC270002018}: property of being accessible and usable on demand by an authorized entity~\cite{ISOIEC270002018} non-repudiation~\cite{ISOIEC250102011,ISOIEC270002018}: ability to prove the occurrence of a claimed event (3.21) or action and its originating entities~\cite{ISOIEC270002018} accountability~\cite{ISOIEC250102011,ISOIEC270002018} and authenticity~\cite{ISOIEC250102011,ISOIEC270002018}: property that an entity is what it claims to be --> compare authentication: provision of assurance that a claimed characteristic of an entity is correct~\cite{ISOIEC270002018}



risk as an effect of uncertainty on objectives, threat as a potential cause of an unwanted incident, which can result in harm to a system or organization. Information security risk is associated with the potential that threats will exploit vulnerabilities of an information asset or group of information assets and thereby cause harm to an organization~\cite{ISOIEC270002018}



information security aims to consider a wide range of threats~\cite{ISOIEC270002018}

attack: attempt to destroy, expose, alter, disable, steal or gain unauthorized access to or make unauthorized use of an asset~\cite{ISOIEC270002018}
