\section{Discussion} \label{sec:discussion}

After describing the extraction results, we give an overview of relevant core insights derived from the results.
Precisely, we present XY \textbf{literature gaps (LG)} we found in the analyzed publications after collaboratively analyzing and discussing the results among this study's authors.
The overall discussion section is oriented towards the three topics of this paper, namely storage, security, and configurable systems. 
Moreover, these three topics are discussed in concert.

\myPar{Storage}
Interestingly, we found out that the concrete understanding of what storage actually is, varies heavily between the selected publications.
In detail, storage is either referred to as concrete medium (e.g., a database), the environment of the medium (e.g., a configurable cloud system), or the cooperation of both, usually with a focus on the environment. 
Our understanding refers to storage as a medium embedded into an environment, which has actually no concrete storing abilities without implementing the medium.
However, we assume that storage is usually used as a generic term for systems which are concerned with certain storage goals or functionalities, leading to \textbf{LG\textsubscript{1}}: \emph{A uniform definition and understanding of storage, especially in the area of configurable systems, is needed} in order to ensure comparable analyses and considerations of storage and the stored data (e.g., in the context of security).

Surprisingly, the uniform assignment of the storage organization structure (i.e., centralized, decentralized, distributed) was hardly possible since the concrete perspective of the publications was not clear.
Precisely, we assume that there exist four possible layers (i.e., perspectives) regarding the organization structure of a system with storage abilities:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
	\item the storage medium, e.g., a database,
	\item the storage environment, e.g., a cloud system, 
	\item the software system, e.g. a robotics system, and
	\item storage hardware, e.g., the server infrastructure.
\end{enumerate}
Each layer might contain systems that are either centralized, decentralized or distributed.
Since such (\textbf{LG\textsubscript{2}}) \emph{uniform definitions regarding the perspective of the organization structure} were not given in any of the papers, comparable assignments are not possible at the moment.
However, we assume that the organizational structure described in the publications usually refers to the storage environment in combination with the software system (e.g., distributed, multi-tenant systems).


\myPar{Security}
Usually no standard is addressed, In only two cases the most relevant standards of the ISO/IEC 27000 series are described, Furthermore, only in one case legal regulations (e.g., medical) are addressed leading to the issue that the solutions hardly provide any practical orientation and can hardly be transferred into practice in their described form
possible reasons for not referring to standard: they don't use it, don't understand it, or not important enough for application (i.e., assume that their applications automatically rely on ISO/IEC 27000 series as it is the most established standard), ggf. kulturelle Einflüsse, abhängigkeit von Verbeitung des Systems (ggf., Industry 4.0 noch nicht weit genug verbreitet, noch nicht interessant genug für Hacker)

security and privacy is lagging behind the technological advances regarding configurable systems and their data storage. Problem in the context of data storage is not new~\cite{strohbach2016big}, differentiated perspectives on security is relevant, i.e., considering system, environment or medium external, internal. usually no focused consideration of individual component, e.g., database. application often rely on security measure for overall system, e.g., firewall, IDS IPS...
no detailed description of concrete encryption, not clear what is encrypted and how (medium with data, communication)

verschiedene Schutzbereiche, je nachdem welche Daten geschützt werden (bspw. persönliche Daten oder medizinische Daten, verschiedene Prioritäten von Daten (z.B. sensoren in Industry 4.0))

Availability und Authorization zusammenhang zu Datenbank, klassische Datenbank ziele, unbewusst richtig gemacht auch ohne Bezug zu Security/CIA
manche security goals angenommen, weil DB das mit sich bringt (Integrity, Non-repudiation)

Unterscheidung von Authorization, Authentification --> ist aber genormt!

\myPar{Configurable Systems}
domains diverse meaning that its usually fundamental research which is not domain specific, more research in collaboration with practitioners is needed
viel implementierung (solution space) 


\myPar{Configurable Systems, Data Storage and Security in Concert}

Moreover, we identified that the databases described in the publications are usually not explained in detail, e.g. whether they are SQL or NoSQL databases or how variable they actually are.
We argue that every type or even variant of a database can possibly lead to new requirements which are relevant for systems, models, or patterns interacting with them, e.g., the underlying software system or concrete security measures such against SQL injection attacks~\cite{humayun2020cyber}.
In addition, it is not clear what impact the general type of databases (e.g., relational), their variability (e.g., in terms of version updates), or the automation of certain database back-end processes (e.g., SQLite for mobile devices) have regarding potential security risks.
This is why we argue that \textbf{(LG\textsubscript{2})} \emph{more research is needed in the context of variable storage mediums, i.e., databases, to understand relevant relationships and to minimize security risks cause by storage variability}.

ggf. security as a feature, um security nicht mehr zu vergessen (z.B. modellierung in FeatureIDE) --> awareness, Sicherheit als konfigurierbar betrachten, wie high-level wird security angesetzt und betrachtet


\subsection{Threats to Validity}

We are aware of some threats that could impair both internal and external validity of our mapping study.
First, the papers' authors usually do not share the same understanding of certain terms and definitions.
This threat is particularly relevant in the context of what is actually understood as storage, e.g., a database as a storage medium or a cloud system as a storage environment.
Second, there is  a lack of completeness in depth of content and consistency in the context of the analyzed papers.
In detail, some authors described their work in great detail, while others only mentioned actually essential properties (e.g., concrete encryption algorithms) or described them only briefly.
However, this is probably due to the fact that we considered both conference papers and journal articles in our study.
Although we aimed to mitigate potential issues in our data analysis, we cannot ensure that this did not impair the comparability or led to misinterpretations on our side.
Third, we found a few issues regarding the fulfillment of certain criteria, e.g., several publications did not provide any description or even a name of tools supporting their work leading to a decreasing comprehensibility and replicability of their work.
Fourth, besides these threats to the internal validity, the external validity could be impaired by the number of included publications (50) in our study.
Although we already considered three databases (i.e., \textsc{Scopus}, \textsc{IEEE Xplore}, and the \textsc{ACM Guide to Computing Literature}), we are aware of the fact that the smaller the number of included literature, the higher the potential of the impact of misclassifications.
In this context, we assume that we potentially missed papers that are related to the covered topics (i.e., security, configurable systems, data storage) due to our overall search strategy, e.g., the search string that does not cover all potential subtopics such as variability modeling.

Although the described issues may threaten our study findings, we aimed to mitigate them by only relying on established literature databases covering relevant and peer-reviewed publications.
Moreover, we considered a large number of papers in our overall systematical evaluation process (i.e., initially 538 publications fetched based on our search string), leading to a decreased threat of missing publications in this research area.
Thus, we argue that our study provides detailed findings regarding security in the context of configurable systems and story which are valuable for the research community.
For future work, we plan to extend our study by conducting a systematic literature review, e.g. examining the relevant topics and their criteria in more detail based on concrete metrics and proving the identified research trends and gaps.
