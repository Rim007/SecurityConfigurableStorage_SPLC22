\citet{Kenner2021MappingStudy}: Mapping study safety and security for configurable software systems

\citet{ahmedConstrainedInteractionTesting2017}: SLR (2005--2016), domain of constraint interaction testing, analyzed 103 publications, of which two involve security concerns (not related to configurable systems)

\citet{hammaniSurveyNonFunctionalRequirements2014b}: survey security concerns as non-functional requirements in the context of modeling and verifying software product lines, high-level overview regarding non-functional requirements, no details on security concerns are missing

\citet{mahdavi-hezavehiVariabilityQualityAttributes2013} SLR (2000--2011) on variability of quality attributes (including security) of service-based software systems, fewer publications (five out of 46) were concerned with security 
security only generally analyzed from high level as quality attribute

\citet{myllarniemi2012systematically} SLR on the variability of quality attributes (2000--2010) which are subject in a SPL-based system (29 papers), security considered as quality attribute from a high level perspective  

\citet{benlachgar2013review} review of product-line engineering techniques to model SaaS applications, assessment of the relevance of the models, no concrete consideration of security 

\citet{geraldi2020software} review of SPL in the context of the internet of things, reviewed 1039 papers. As cloud systems are usually based on the IoT, it is considered, but not examined in detail. Security is only considered as extracted data of in the context of non-functional requirements
